# Restricted Report for Course Project
Course project for *Digital Signal Processing* and *Stochastic Process* respectively. This Repo is publicized strictly after all my classmates get graded.

Normally the two courses completely change their topics for project each year, **but COPYING and other use of this repo that VIOLATE your course policy is still STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**. Apart from that, all the use of this repo basically follows a CC-BY-4.0 license.

## Citing
I would be very amazed if my course projects were useful for your research. Please contact me then.
